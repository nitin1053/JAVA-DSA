 inheritance

 parents--> chilren
 in oops  inheritance child class has all the acces of the parent class
 child class is inheriting properties from parent class

 class child extends base(parent)

 child class is something which has a some properties from  base class
 and some of its own properties

Types of inheritance
single inheritance -one class extends anoher class

multi level inheritance-when one class extending more than one classes
not allowed in java because of the confusion of the same property
but we can do this by using interface

4.hierarchial inheritace-

5. hybrid inheritance -combine of both the inheritace (not allowed in java due )

Easy

Polymorphosm(many ways to representation )
Types
1. compile time polymorphism/static polymorphism
method overloading

2.Runtime polymorphism achieved by method overiding

Parent obj=new child
here which method will be called on this is known as upcasting

Encapsulation-wrapping up the data members and method in a class

abstartion--hiding the unnecessay thing andd showing only the required things
